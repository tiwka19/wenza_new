                Carbide inserts, also known as cemented carbide inserts, are cutting tools crafted from a combination of tungsten carbide and cobalt.
                This composition imparts outstanding hardness and resistance to wear and heat, making carbide inserts an ideal choice for demanding
                machining tasks. The exceptional durability of carbide inserts ensures they maintain their edge and cutting efficiency for an extended
                period.
