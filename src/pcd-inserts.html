                Polycrystalline diamond inserts, often referred to as PCD inserts, are made from synthetic diamond particles sintered together under
                high pressure and temperature. This process creates a cutting tool that is can withstand extreme conditions and machine the hardest
                materials such as non-ferrous metals, titanium- & aluminium-based alloys, composites, plastics, glass, ceramics and much more.

                  PCD inserts can be used across a wide range of materials and offer machining complex workpieces with a single cutter. This
                  versatility makes them suitable for various industries and applications.

                  PCD inserts can deliver exceptional surface finishes and dimensional accuracy equal to that when grinding. They are known for
                  producing smooth, high-quality surfaces, reducing the need for secondary finishing processes.

                  While PCD inserts may have a higher initial cost, their extended lifespan and reduced downtime contribute to significant cost
                  savings over time. The return on investment becomes evident as production cycles become more efficient and reliable.
